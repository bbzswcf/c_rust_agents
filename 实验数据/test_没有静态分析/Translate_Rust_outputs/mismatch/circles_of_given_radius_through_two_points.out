Case 1:

Two circles are possible.

Circle C1 with center (1.86311,1.97421), radius 2.0000 and Circle C2 with center (-0.86321,-0.75211), radius 2.0000

Case 2:

Given points are opposite ends of a diameter of the circle with center (0.00000,1.00000) and radius 1.0000

Case 3:

Infinitely many circles can be drawn through (0.12340,0.98760)

Case 4:

Given points are farther away from each other than a diameter of a circle with radius 0.5000

Case 5:

No circles can be drawn through (0.12340,0.98760)
